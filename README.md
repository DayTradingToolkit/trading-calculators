## 💡 Why Use Trading Calculators?

**The harsh reality:** Proper position sizing and risk management can mean the difference between long-term profitability and blowing up your account.

Most traders fail not because they pick bad trades, but because they:
- ❌ Risk too much on a single trade
- ❌ Don't have defined stop losses
- ❌ Chase losses with bigger positions
- ❌ Ignore the mathematics of risk/reward

**These calculators help you:**
- ✅ Stay disciplined with predefined risk
- ✅ Avoid emotional position sizing
- ✅ Calculate realistic profit expectations
- ✅ Understand the true cost of trading
- ✅ Plan exits before entering
